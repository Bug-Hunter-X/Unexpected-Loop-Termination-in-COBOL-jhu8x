This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in COBOL programs involving loop control and conditional exits.  The provided COBOL code contains a `PERFORM` loop with a condition to exit prematurely. However, the interaction between the loop counter and the exit condition may lead to the loop finishing before the expected number of iterations.  The solution demonstrates a corrected version.
